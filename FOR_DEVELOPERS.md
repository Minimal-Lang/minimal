# For Developers

The compiler has 2 parts:
 - The binary ([src/bin/minc](src/bin/minc/))
 - The library ([src/](src/))

Visit the [docs](https://www.github.com/Minimal-Lang/docs/tree/main/compiler) repo for documentation (written in mdBook).

If there's anything you need to know about the compiler (which you couldn't find), reach out to JuniorBecari10 (@juniorbecari10), TadaHrd (@tadahrd), or any other developer on the [Minimal Discord server](https://discord.gg/Qnb3MgNfQG).
